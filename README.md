# Fashion Spectrum 👗

Discover your own fashion taste.

Fashion Spectrum analyzes the images you intuitively like and reveals the underlying style tendencies behind them.

---

## Concept

What does your "favorite" really mean?

By selecting images you feel drawn to, this app:

- Visualizes your fashion orientation  
- Translates it into descriptive language  
- Quantifies it into measurable axes  

The goal is to make your sense of style visible and understandable.

---

## How it Works

The app leverages a machine learning model to extract feature embeddings from selected images and analyzes patterns across them.

---

## Tech

- Python
- Streamlit
- CLIP (Contrastive Language–Image Model)
- Visualization tools

---

## Roadmap

Future enhancements may include:

- Color-based feature analysis  
- Shape and silhouette detection  
- Material and texture understanding  
- Multi-axis style mapping
